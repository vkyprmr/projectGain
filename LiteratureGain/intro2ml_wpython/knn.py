    As you can see on the left in the figure, using a single neighbor results in a decision boundary that follows the training data closely. Considering more and more neighbors leads to a smoother decision boundary. A smoother boundary corresponds to a simpler model. In other words, using few neighbors corresponds to high model complexity (as shown on the right side of Figure 2-1), and using many neighbors corresponds to low model complexity (as shown on the left side of Figure 2-1). If you consider the extreme case where the number of neighbors is the number of all data points in the training set, each test point would have exactly the same neighbors (all training points) and all predictions would be the same: the class that is most frequent in the training set.
